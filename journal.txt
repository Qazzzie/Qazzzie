The first problem I encountered was that git no longer 
would allow me to push with my saved password and I had to figure out
how to authenticate my pushes with a personal access token... Which was not entirely
clear how to achieve on linux mint. So then I had to set up SSH and pray it worked on vscode 
after I followed all the steps.
