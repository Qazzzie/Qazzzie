The first problem I encountered was that git no longer 
would allow me to push with my saved password and I had to figure out
how to authenticate my pushes with a personal access token... Which was not entirely
clear how to achieve on linux mint. So then I had to set up SSH and pray it worked on vscode 
after I followed all the steps. I started the general layout of the files and html elements of the page so I 
could add some authentic content to move around and begin customizing. I 
made the text in my about section highlight for each letter using javascript.
I am attempting to use jekyll to enable multiple pages to be navigatable urls in github pages.
I get 404 when I attempt to go to any page other than index.html. It works fine on localhost.
I made the pain paragraph in my about section highlight for each letter upon hover. I thought it
was nifty. I learned how to efficiently use classes and id's as I'm creating my patterns in the page so that there are less 
colliding css properties.
